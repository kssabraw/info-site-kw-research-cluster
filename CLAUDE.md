# CLAUDE.md

This file is read automatically by Claude Code at the start of every session. It contains the persistent context, locked decisions, and rules that apply to **every** milestone in this build. Read it first, then the PRD.

## What this project is

The **Topic Fanout Tool** is a keyword research and niche-site architecture planning app. Given a single seed keyword, it produces a complete content map for a niche authority site: silos (top-level subfolders), articles within each silo with target keywords and H2 outlines, and an internal linking structure.

The PRD is the source of truth for everything: **`docs/topic-fanout-prd-v1_7.md`** (or the highest version number present in `docs/`). Read it in full before doing significant work. When the PRD conflicts with what you'd otherwise suggest, the PRD wins.

---

## Repo context

This repo was **reset on 2026-05-21** after a previous 12-phase implementation was archived. The reset is intentional. Treat the repo as empty:

- Do not try to recover code from the archived implementation.
- Do not pattern-match the previous "12-phase" architecture; this build uses a different design (silos → article planning orchestrator → architecture) per the PRD.
- A git bundle of the old code exists separately for human reference only.

---

## Locked architectural decisions

These don't change session-to-session. Don't propose alternatives.

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Source repo | `kssabraw/info-site-kw-research-cluster` (monorepo: `backend/`, `frontend/`, `supabase/`, `docs/`) |
| Backend | FastAPI (Python 3.11) on Railway, project `AR Tools`, service `info-site-kw-research-cluster` |
| Frontend | React + Vite + TypeScript, deployed to Netlify from `/frontend` |
| Database | Supabase shared with AR Tools, **all tables isolated under the `fanout` schema** |
| Auth | Supabase Auth, role-based access via `fanout.user_profiles.role` (owner / va) |
| LLM (silo discovery) | OpenAI `gpt-5.4` with browsing |
| LLM (orchestrator + architecture) | Anthropic `claude-opus-4-7` with tool-use mode for strict-schema JSON |
| Embeddings | OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small` |
| External data | DataForSEO (Labs + SERP + Keyword Data) |
| Clustering | NetworkX + python-louvain |

API keys (DataForSEO, OpenAI, Anthropic, Supabase) are already configured at the Railway project level and inherited by this service. No new keys need provisioning.

## Milestone discipline

The build is sequenced into 11 milestones (M1–M11) defined in PRD §15.1. **Build one milestone at a time.** After each, stop and wait for human review before starting the next.

Rules that apply to every milestone:

- **Don't pre-build for later milestones.** Tempting optimizations like "I'll add the keywords table now since we'll need it in M3" are out of scope. Each milestone owns its schema additions.
- **One feature branch per milestone**, named `m{N}-{short-name}` (e.g., `m1-foundation`, `m2-silo-discovery`). Don't push directly to `main`.
- **Logical commits within a milestone** (separate commits for schema, backend, frontend, etc.) rather than one giant commit.
- **End-of-milestone summary** is required: what was built, decisions made on ambiguous points, anything to flag for human review, and verification steps.

The active milestone is tracked at the bottom of this file (`## Active milestone`). Update it when transitioning.

---

## Working style

**Match existing patterns where you can see them.** The Dockerfile pattern for the backend should mirror `services/nlp` in the `showup-local` repo per PRD §14.2. For things you can't see (existing schemas in shared Supabase, conventions in other AR Tools services), ask before assuming.

**Supabase migrations:**
- One file per migration, named `2026XXXX_{description}.sql`, under `supabase/migrations/`.
- All tables go under the `fanout` schema. Never create tables in `public`.
- Use **real** RLS policies derived from PRD §11.2 (capability matrix) and §13 (RLS summary). **Never** use `using (true)` placeholders.
- Add a defensive check at the top of the M1 migration that fails loud if the `fanout` schema already exists (the previous archived implementation may have left remnants).

**Structured logging from day one.** Use `python-json-logger` or equivalent. The log shape is defined in PRD §16.3. Every external API call gets logged with cost, latency, and correlation_id.

**Frontend conventions:**
- Use TanStack Query for server state.
- No browser storage APIs for app data — everything goes through the backend to Supabase.
- Components in `/frontend/src/owner/` (Owner UI) and `/frontend/src/va/` (VA wizard) are separate; shared code goes in `/frontend/src/shared/`.

**When PRD ambiguity surfaces:**
- Flag it, pick the most conservative interpretation, and mention it in the end-of-milestone summary.
- Don't silently guess.
- PRD open questions Q2–Q18 are tuning values for later milestones (relevance thresholds, SERP overlap thresholds, etc.). None of them block any milestone's structural work; flag if one appears to.

---

## Never

- Never propose alternatives to the locked decisions above.
- Never create tables outside the `fanout` schema in Supabase.
- Never use `using (true)` RLS policies.
- Never reference or try to recover the archived previous implementation.
- Never push directly to `main`. Always go through a feature branch.
- Never pre-build work that belongs to a later milestone.
- Never store sensitive data in logs (API keys, user passwords, raw service_role tokens).
- Never bypass the cost cap / approval workflow for VA-initiated sessions.

## Common commands

(Populated as the build progresses. M1 establishes the initial set.)


```bash
# Backend: run locally
cd backend && uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# Backend: deploy to Railway
railway up --service info-site-kw-research-cluster

# Frontend: run locally
cd frontend && npm run dev

# Frontend: build for production
cd frontend && npm run build

# Supabase: apply pending migrations
supabase db push

# Supabase: generate types from current schema
supabase gen types typescript --project-id <ref> > frontend/src/shared/db-types.ts
```

## Active milestone

**M3 — Expansion pipeline** (in progress)

M1 — Foundation: **complete** (signed off 2026-05-21). Built on `m1-foundation`.

M2 — Silo discovery + user review: **complete** (signed off 2026-05-23). Grounding
pass + demand sample + SERP-structure scrape + GPT-5.4 silo proposal; disambiguation
gate; silo review (remove/add/edit/override audience); finalize embeds silos into
`topics`. Validated against `retatrutide` (clean silos, zero peer-entity leakage)
and `mercury` (disambiguation gate fires). Built on `m2-silo-discovery`; M1+M2 then
merged to `main`, which is now the single deploy branch for Railway and Netlify.
Backend env reads `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`/`SUPABASE_KEY` aliases (AR Tools naming).

M3 Done state (per PRD §15.1):
- Per-silo DataForSEO expansion (`keyword_ideas`, `keyword_suggestions`,
  `query_fanouts`, PAA two tiers deep) runs in parallel for all finalized silos.
- Autocomplete enrichment runs on the surfaced (deduped) keyword pool.
- All keywords persist to the `keywords` table with source attribution.
- **No competitor mining / relevance gate / clustering yet** — those are M4.

When M3 is complete and approved, update this section to reflect M4 as the active milestone.
