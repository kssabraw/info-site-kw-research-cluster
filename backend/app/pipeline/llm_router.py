"""LLM routing for ambiguous keywords (routing-calibration second pass).

After the gate's cosine Lever-3 picks a best silo for each keyword, identify
the ambiguous cases — those whose top-1 vs top-2 silo-anchor cosine margin is
below a threshold — and have the LLM rule on them in batches. Cheap because
only the ambiguous fraction goes through the LLM; the easy cases stay on the
fast embedding path.

Each ambiguous keyword carries the gate's full candidate-silo list (the silos
in which the keyword was a candidate); the LLM may pick any of them. If the
LLM picks a silo NOT in the candidate list (it shouldn't, but defensive), the
caller ignores that pick — the cosine assignment stands.

Failure is benign: a batch that errors yields no reassignments for its
keywords, which keep their cosine routing.
