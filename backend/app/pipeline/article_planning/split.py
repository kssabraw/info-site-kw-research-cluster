"""Salience split: divide an over-large article into sub-articles (PRD §7.10).

The orchestrator (and direct mode) can leave a single article carrying hundreds
of keywords that actually span several sub-topics. This pass re-clusters such an
article's keywords by embedding similarity — reusing the §7.9 Louvain machinery at
a higher resolution — and, when it cleanly divides into multiple coherent
sub-communities, splits it into separate articles.

Design choices (see the chat decision):
- **Salience, not SERP overlap.** Keyword embeddings are already the clustering
  signal and are essentially free (no DataForSEO); a SERP-per-keyword pass would
  cost ~$3-4 + minutes per run. SERP-overlap confirmation can be layered on later.
- **Targeted, not global.** Only articles above `min_keywords` are considered, so
  coherent small articles are never touched.
- **No thin stubs.** Sub-communities below `min_subarticle_size` fold back into the
  largest sub-cluster, so the long-tail stays attached rather than shattering into
  singleton articles. A split only happens when ≥2 substantial sub-clusters remain.
- **Runs before cross-topic dedup**, so the new sub-article primaries are
  deduped against the rest of the plan like any other article.
