"""Peer-entity-aware article grouping (owner-requested follow-up to §7.10).

Background: the orchestrator clusters by keyword embedding similarity. Keywords
that name DIFFERENT peer entities (e.g. `switching from tirzepatide to retatrutide`
vs. `switching from zepbound to retatrutide`) embed nearly identically — only the
peer-name token differs, and the model sees those tokens as semantically close —
so Louvain bundles them as one community and the orchestrator inherits one
combined article. But editorially they are DIFFERENT articles: each names a
different peer.

This pass uses the deterministic peer-entity list (already produced by grounding
at session creation, used by the §7.6 off-niche filter) to partition the
planner's articles by the peer entity each keyword names. **Cross-topic**:
keywords naming the same peer collapse into exactly one article across the
ENTIRE plan (not one per topic), so there's nothing duplicate for cross-topic
dedup to chew on — which is what hollowed out the smaller silos in the
per-topic implementation.

Each peer article's home topic is the one that contributed the most keywords to
its bucket (ties broken deterministically by first occurrence). Multi-peer
keywords (`X vs Y vs Z`) form their own multi-peer bucket.

Design choices:
- **Cross-topic, single home topic per peer.** No duplicate peer articles -> no
  dedup elimination cascade. The smaller silos keep their non-peer articles.
- **No minimum size.** A peer mention is a deterministic signal — even one
  keyword naming a unique peer becomes its own primary (zero supporting kw OK).
- **Whole-word peer match** (substring-safe), case-insensitive.
- **Runs BEFORE the salience split**, so peer-entity (stronger signal) gets
  first dibs; salience split then handles any oversized leftover non-peer articles.
