"""Relevance gate + dedup + junk filter (PRD §7.6).

Every candidate keyword is checked against its parent topic's embedding by
cosine similarity. This is the pipeline's volume control point — and the step
that finally sorts the seed-level keyword pool (suggestions/fan-outs were fanned
to every silo in §7.3) into the silo each keyword actually belongs to.

- Cross-source dedup happens upstream: the per-topic pools are keyed by the
  normalized keyword, so duplicate surfacings already merged while preserving
  source attribution. Here we only score and classify.
- Embedding dedup happens here: because the seed-level pool fans the same
  keyword into many silos, we embed each *unique* keyword once across all silos
  (not once per silo) and reuse the vector.
- Junk filter (cheap, pre-embedding): blocked tokens + length sanity.
- Relevance: cosine >= threshold (default 0.62) -> active, else
  filtered_relevance. Junk -> filtered_junk. Nothing is deleted; failures are
  tagged and stored for v1 calibration.

Resilience: a per-batch embedding failure (or a short/mismatched batch) degrades
only that batch's keywords — they're kept `active` and unscored — rather than
aborting the whole run. Embeddings for surviving keywords are returned so the
clustering step (§7.9) can reuse them rather than re-embedding.
