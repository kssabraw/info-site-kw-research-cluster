"""Run cost estimation (PRD §8.1 cost matrix / §8.4 cost gate).

A pure, side-effect-free model that turns a run config (coverage mode, silo
count, deep-mine count, recursive fanout, metrics) into an estimated dollar cost.
The §8.4 approval gate (M9, §11.3) compares this estimate to the workspace soft
cap; the wizard surfaces it in the cost-confirmation step.

The per-component rates are derived from the §8.1 table, which is itself an
estimate at a representative config (5 silos, 3 deep-mined). They reconstruct the
table's subtotals within a few cents at that point and scale sensibly with silo /
deep-mine count, so an unusually large run (e.g. a 10-silo comprehensive run)
exceeds the cap while standard+metrics and comprehensive+metrics stay under it —
which is exactly the §8.4 intent. Update the rates after the first ~10 production
runs surface real numbers (per §8.1).
