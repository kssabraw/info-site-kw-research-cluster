"""Bind a cost meter to a run and flush it to the session (PRD §16.4).

`metered_run` is for the background pipeline jobs: it binds a `CostMeter` on the
job thread (so nested worker threads inherit it via `ContextThreadPoolExecutor`),
spawns a daemon that flushes the running total to `sessions.actual_cost_usd` +
`cost_breakdown` every `cost_flush_interval_s`, and does a final flush on exit —
including on failure, so a crashed/partial run still records the cost spent so far
(§16.4 "final flush on step completion or session terminal state").

`metered_sync` is for the short synchronous silo-discovery call in the request
path: bind + single final flush, no periodic thread.

Cost accumulates across a session's runs (expand → plan → architecture, plus any
re-plan/regate/fanout): each flush atomically *increments* `actual_cost_usd` +
`cost_breakdown` by the spend since the previous flush (`increment_session_cost`,
row-locked in SQL), so the persisted figure is the session's real cumulative cost
(matches §16.4 "the session's running cost"). The delta increment is correct even when
several writers touch the same session at once — the M15 scheduler drains up to `cap`
article writes of one session concurrently, which the old base+absolute write lost.
