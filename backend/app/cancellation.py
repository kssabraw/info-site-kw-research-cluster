"""Cooperative cancellation for pipeline runs.

A `POST /sessions/{id}/cancel` flips the session to `cancelled` and signals the
background worker via a `threading.Event` registered here. The worker — and the
nested DataForSEO/OpenAI/Anthropic call sites it spawns — call
`raise_if_cancelled()` before each external request; finding the event set, they
raise `CancelledByUser`, which propagates out of the pipeline (through
`except Exception` handlers in pipeline code, because it's a BaseException —
same propagation rule as KeyboardInterrupt) and is caught at the top of each
`run_*_job` in `jobs.py`, which writes the terminal status.

In-flight HTTP requests are not aborted (sync httpx doesn't cancel cleanly
mid-flight), so worst-case wait after cancel ≈ one DataForSEO timeout (60s).
Saves cost on every subsequent call.
